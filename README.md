• < 768 mobile - each column should start from the new line
To comply with the examination task, the layout ofthe web document should be built with Bootstrap 4 technology and forappropriate appearance (background images, colors of the text, font size,space inside elements...) CSS styles have the role to be used. Custom styling mustbe applied as an external file.
